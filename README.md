## Welcome in my main Java project :

# SAUSAGES AREN'T BURNT ENOUGH FOR HELL

This project is made to discover Java language and more specifically OOP in Java.
It is a board game where a player creates his character. Each turn he will go deeper in the dungeon represented by squares. 
Each square can contains randomly : nothing, a treasure, a monster he'll have to fight.
Once the player reaches the end, he wins. But if he runs out of health during his journey, his sausages won't never be burnt enough for hell.
## Set-up :
- JDK : Java 17.0.12
